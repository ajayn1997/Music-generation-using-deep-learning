# Music-generation-using-deep-learning
This project aims to create realistic music in abc-notation using char-RNN architecture. The char-RNN is trained on a corpus of musical notes encoded using the abc-notation. The trained network is able to generate new musical notes in the abc-notation. This project uses the concepts of generating text using RNNs and applies it to create a textual representation of music.
